						<h2>veggie 'Vette Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

						<h4> What kind of milage do you get? </h4>
<p>
						the 'vette gets about 40mpg on the highway on biodiesel.  Reports say that milage and power output are roughly equivalent on veggie, but I haven't taken any accurate measurements of milage yet, but I'd like to get a reading soon.
</p>
						<h4> Do you really get fuel for free?</h4>
<p>

My favorite question when hitting up a restaurant for free oil is "so, how much are you going to charge me to take this stuff?".   Negative cost fuel!     I do it for free, as a community service of course.    Pre-processing the oil is labour intensive though, so I don't like to think about my 
hourly pay for doing all the filtering and collecting work.
</p>
						<h4> Why doesn't this rocketsled have a front seat? </h4>
<p>
How many times have you been given a ride in a limousine and sat in front with the driver?     Never.   I wanted to enforce the festive atmosphere and let the passengers wrap themselves in all the luxurious splendor the 'Vette has to offer, in case they got some fool idea that this is just any other car and mistakenly sat in the front seat.
