Operation Grease 'Vette is based on a 1982 diesel Chevette, purchased for $425USD.   The diesel 'Vette has achieved cult status, and is the world's rarest collectors car.   The best place to start learning about Chevette World is at the amazing <a href="http://w3.one.net/~watscarb/dieselvette.htm"> Bob's Chevette Page</a>.

<p> Shortly after obtaining and registering the vehicle, I tanked up with B100 biodiesel from <a href="http://www.fuelwerks.com">Dr. Dan's Fuelwerks</a> here in Seattle.   Every diesel vehicle in the greater Seattle area should be suckling from Dan's bioD repository.   The fuel is remarkably delicious, and Dan's a right nice chap to boot.

<a href="http://www.chronotechnic.com">Chronotechnic</a>, a talented Seattle based java consulting company, would end that same week.

    So with bucketsful of free time, a simple schematic from Greasel, two Chevette shop manuals, and far more hubris than skills in the black arts of diesel mechanitchery, I popped the hood.
